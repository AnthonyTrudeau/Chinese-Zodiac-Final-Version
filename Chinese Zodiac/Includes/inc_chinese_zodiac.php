    <p>The Chinese Zodiac is based off of the year that you are born in and is represented by an animal,
the rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Sheep, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, and Pig. Your birth year is said to
shape your destiny. There are two main legends on the origins of the Chinese Zodiac, the first one
 is that when Buddha summoned all the animals to come to him before he left the Earth only 12 came.
 The 12 being the 12 animals stated above, so he named the years by which one came first, aka the
 Rat was first Ox second. The second one is that the Jade Emperor held a race, in which the Rat had
 rode on the Ox until the end and ended up first. 

The Chinese and Western Zodiac show extremely different world views, while Western is based off of birth month,
 and Chinese is based off of the year that you are born. They do have some similarities, the Chinese 12 year
 is mirrored in Western Zodiac by the 12 years it takes for Jupiter to revolve around the sun. Where as 
there is a similarity where the monthly Zodiac used in western is mirrored in the Chinese Zodiac by 
the 4 week periods in which the animals dominate during the year.
While the Chinese and Western Zodiac have similarities, they show differences in the ways that different cultures
look at their own Zodiacs.
